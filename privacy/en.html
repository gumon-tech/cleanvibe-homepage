                <li>The initial face image is uploaded by the site administrator to the face recognition system via the admin panel.

                <li>During clock-in/out, face recognition is performed by sending face images to a recognition API, which returns the employee code. Once this process is complete, the face image is immediately deleted from the system.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li>The raw image of the employeeâ€™s face is stored in our storage service (e.g., Amazon S3). Face vector data is processed and stored in the database for authentication purposes.</li>
                <li>All sensitive face vector data is encrypted and stored securely. Face images used during clock-in/out are stored temporarily and deleted immediately after processing.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

            <ul>
                <li>Face images uploaded initially by the administrator are stored permanently for employee management purposes.</li>
                <li>Clock-in/out face images are deleted immediately after the process is complete.</li>
                <li>Face vector data is retained only during the employment period and is deleted when no longer necessary or upon termination of employment.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Location Usage:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li>We collect and store latitude and longitude coordinates to verify employee clock-in locations at the work site. This location data is not shared with third parties and is only used for internal management processes.</li>
